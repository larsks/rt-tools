Scripts
-------

findq - Generate a list of queues by matching a custom field.  We use this to
select queues for rt-crontool processing using a custom field named
"Processing flags".

escalate-tickets - Uses findq and rt-controol to apply
RT::Action::LinearEscalate to selected queues.

shred-tickets - Uses findq and rt-shredder to remove deleted tickets.

Custom fields
-------------

Many of these scripts rely on the "Processing flags" custom field, defined
in customfields.xml.
